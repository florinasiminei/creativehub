description: Ensure new files are created cleanly with full content using create_new_file
Always applied
When creating a new file:

1. Use `create_new_file`.
2. Provide the full file content â€” no placeholders.
3. Use relative file paths (e.g., `src/components/Button.tsx`).
4. If the file will be imported somewhere, follow up by editing that file to add the import.
